                    <p>

                    <p>
                    My senior thesis project focused on the first implementation of quantum dots for electrons-on-helium, to enable ensemble quantum computing and simulation. Since single-electron detection is challenging for electrons-on-helium, our device intended to improve read-out fidelity by simultaneously measuring several quantum dots. I developed nano-fabrication techniques to construct large arrays (~ 10^9) of nearly identical metal-oxide quantum dots. This included extreme fine-tuning of the photolithography and etching steps to ensure uniform shape and depth of the individual dots across the array. I also worked on exact and approximate (Hartree Fock and Constant-Interaction) theoretical models to predict the energy transitions within these many-electron quantum dots. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The size of each dot within these arrays can be varied as per the scientific application. Larger dots (>1um) can be used to simulate atoms by populating them with many electrons, whereas smaller ones (< 100nm) can be used for quantum computing through electron-spin-resonance (ESR) measurements.

                    We explored the 'quantum demolition' effects of dispersive readout in circuit QED. Theoretical models predict that qubit relaxation increases with the mean photon number in the associated readout resonator. We compare these models with experimental data from qubits qubits available through the IBM Quantum Experience (IBM Qiskit Pulse) as well through collaboration with experimental groups. Since the research is on-going, some experimental results have been witheld from the final report.

                    We develop a set of nano-fabrication techniques which consistently achieve increased T1 coherence times for Transmon qubits - with an average exceeding 0.30ms, almost three-times the longest T1 previously published (0.114ms).

                        We present a scalable model to represent multi-subject, multi-dataset fMRI 
                        data in the same learned latent space. Firstly, we cluster similar subjects based on the tensor decomposition of the input data. Then, we use regularized gradient descent on the data from similar subjects to learn the shared latent space. Our best model consistently achieves accuracies over 85%. Moreover, our chosen regularization ensure scalability and low computational complexity.

                    We explore time-evolving graphs, where each node's 'opinion' is updated at every time-step to match the majority opinion held by its neighbors. After several time-steps, a winning opinion is declared by performing a majority vote on the population. We provide theory which shows that certain graphs eventually hold a majority incorrect opinion, despite each node being initially biased towards the correct opinion. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the effects of various seeding and opinion-recovery methods.

We construct sensors and valves from common hardware and 3D-printed parts, significantly reducing the cost-of-build without sacrificing safety. Our final design costs under $300, which is about one-tenth the cost of off-the-shelf solutions.
